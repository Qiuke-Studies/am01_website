Hello! I am Mingqi, and this is my website - built as a project for my AM01 Applied Statistics course here at London Business School!

I was born and raised in Shanghai, China. At age 14, I left home to study here in the UK. Graduating with a degree in Economics, I joined LBS earlier this year to read for Masters in Analytics and Management.

Born into a typical Chinese household, I picked up an instrument quite early on in my life. Piano first, then percussion in primary school. I joined a choir in primary school too, and have really enjoyed myself there. I managed to keep singing and playing percussion going into (and out of) university, joining a musical production at the Edinburgh Fringe 2022 this summer, and joining the LBS music club exco team. 

I hope to step up my data analysis game here at LBS to put R and other skills to use to solve real-life problems in work in the future! 

Please find my CV here.
