# Dataset
Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns.

```{r, load_data}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

# Weight and the level of activity
One relationship we might be interested in exploring is the activity level and the weight of the individual. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
By running an EDA on weight, we can see that weight is relatively right-skewed, meaning that most youth are of lower weight relative to the range of weights, and few youth are obese in the sample. 

```{r, eda_on_weight}

skim(yrbss) #count number of NAs in weight - 1004; summary statistics

yrbss %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weight)) +
    geom_density() +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(title = "Distribution of Youth Weight",
         x = "Weight", 
         y = "Density")
```

## Relationship Between Weight and Physical Activity Level
I am someone who exercises (ie. walks) around 3 days a week, sometimes lower. 


```{r, mutate_and_count}
# Create indicator for activity level
yrbss <- yrbss %>%
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >= 3, "yes", "no"))

#Count number of individuals active versus not active using count
count <- yrbss %>%
  count(physical_3plus) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n/sum(n) * 100)

count

#Count number of individuals active versus not active using group_by & summarise
group_by <- yrbss %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percentage = count/sum(count) * 100)

group_by

# There are almost half of individuals as active individuals who are less active. There is also NAs in level of activity in this dataset.
```
